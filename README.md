# Railway Control

A custom railway control system to control a DC model railway.

## Architecture

As model railways can be complex, especially DC model railways that rely
on isolated sections of track to control which trains move when, the
control system is split into multiple sections connected together.
Listed below are the boards that may be used in the system.

- Control Panel
- Control Unit
- Motor Driver
- Track Relay
- Point Driver

For information on system architecture, see
